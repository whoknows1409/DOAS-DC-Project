## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### Daily Development

```bash
# Start working
./scripts/start.sh

# Check if everything is running
./scripts/status.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop when done
./scripts/stop.sh
```

---

### Testing & Demo

```bash
# Start fresh
./scripts/complete-reset.sh
./scripts/start.sh

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### 1. **Starting Development Session**

```bash
# Quick start
./scripts/start.sh

# Or with verbose output
./scripts/start.sh start
```

### 2. **After Making Code Changes**

```bash
# Rebuild and restart
./scripts/docker-build.sh
./scripts/restart.sh
```

### 3. **Preparing for Demo**

```bash
# Clean slate
./scripts/complete-reset.sh

# Build fresh
./scripts/docker-build.sh

# Start system
./scripts/start.sh

# Validate
./scripts/validate-system.sh

# Run demo
./scripts/demo-complete-system.sh
```

### 4. **Before Committing to Git**

```bash
# Verify codebase is clean
./scripts/verify-github-ready.sh

# Stop application
./scripts/stop.sh

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
```

### 5. **Troubleshooting Issues**

```bash
# Step 1: Check status
./scripts/status.sh

# Step 2: View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Step 3: Try restart
./scripts/restart.sh

# Step 4: If still broken, complete reset
./scripts/complete-reset.sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

## üìä Script Permissions

All scripts should be executable. If you get "permission denied":

```bash
# Make all scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Or individual script
chmod +x scripts/start.sh
```

---

## üîç Environment Variables

Some scripts use environment variables. See `.env.example` for configuration options:

```bash
# Copy example environment
cp .env.example .env

# Edit as needed
nano .env
```

---

## üìù Notes

1. **Always use scripts from project root:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/auction-system
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

2. **Docker must be running:**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is started (on Mac/Windows)
   - Docker daemon is running (on Linux)

3. **Ports must be available:**
   - 80 (Nginx)
   - 5432 (PostgreSQL)
   - 6379 (Redis)
   - 8081, 8082, 8083 (Backend servers)
   - 1101, 1102, 1103 (RMI ports)

4. **Script execution order matters:**
   - Stop before complete reset
   - Build before start (after code changes)
   - Validate after start

---

## üÜò Getting Help

Each script has a help option:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh help
./scripts/start.sh --help
./scripts/start.sh -h
```
