# 🎬 Real-Time Bidding Demonstration Guide

## 🎯 **How to Demonstrate Real-Time Bidding with 2 Users**

### **Setup: Two Browser Windows**

You'll use **2 different browser windows** (or browsers) to simulate 2 different users bidding in real-time.

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Demo Instructions**

### **STEP 1: Create Two Users**

#### Window 1 - Create User 1:
1. Open **Google Chrome** (or your main browser)
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost**
3. Click **"Register here"**
4. Register first user:
   - **Username**: `bidder1`
   - **Email**: `bidder1@example.com`
   - **Password**: `password123`
5. Click **"Register"**
6. You'll be redirected to the auction list

#### Window 2 - Create User 2:
1. Open **Firefox** (or Incognito/Private window in Chrome)
   - **Chrome**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
   - **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Navigate to: **http://localhost**
3. Click **"Register here"**
4. Register second user:
   - **Username**: `bidder2`
   - **Email**: `bidder2@example.com`
   - **Password**: `password123`
5. Click **"Register"**
6. You'll be redirected to the auction list

> **💡 Tip**: Use different browsers or incognito windows so both users can be logged in simultaneously!

---

### **STEP 2: Both Users Select the Same Auction**

#### In Both Windows:
1. Look at the auction list
2. Choose the **same auction** (e.g., "Vintage Guitar")
3. Click **"View Details"** on that auction
4. You should see:
   - Auction title and description
   - Current price (e.g., $500)
   - Bid history
   - Bid input field and "Place Bid" button

---

### **STEP 3: Arrange Windows Side-by-Side**

1. **Resize both browser windows** to fit side-by-side on your screen
2. **Window 1 (Chrome)** on the LEFT - User: `bidder1`
3. **Window 2 (Firefox/Incognito)** on the RIGHT - User: `bidder2`

```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   Chrome/Normal     │  Firefox/Incognito  │
│   User: bidder1     │   User: bidder2     │
│                     │                     │
│  Current: $500      │  Current: $500      │
│  [Enter Bid]        │  [Enter Bid]        │
│  [Place Bid]        │  [Place Bid]        │
│                     │                     │
│  Bid History:       │  Bid History:       │
│  - (none yet)       │  - (none yet)       │
└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### **STEP 4: Start the Bidding War! 🔥**

#### **Round 1 - User 1 Bids:**
1. **Window 1 (bidder1)**:
   - Enter bid amount: **600**
   - Click **"Place Bid"**
   - ✅ See: "Bid placed successfully!"
   - ✅ Current price updates to **$600**
   - ✅ Your bid appears in history

2. **Window 2 (bidder2)**:
   - **WATCH**: After 5 seconds (or immediately via WebSocket)
   - ✅ Current price updates to **$600**
   - ✅ New bid appears in bid history
   - ✅ Info message: "New bid placed: $600"

#### **Round 2 - User 2 Responds:**
3. **Window 2 (bidder2)**:
   - Enter bid amount: **650**
   - Click **"Place Bid"**
   - ✅ See: "Bid placed successfully!"
   - ✅ Current price updates to **$650**

4. **Window 1 (bidder1)**:
   - **WATCH**: After 5 seconds
   - ✅ Current price updates to **$650**
   - ✅ New bid from bidder2 appears

#### **Round 3 - User 1 Counter-Bids:**
5. **Window 1 (bidder1)**:
   - Enter bid amount: **700**
   - Click **"Place Bid"**
   - ✅ Updates immediately

6. **Window 2 (bidder2)**:
   - **WATCH**: Updates after 5 seconds
   - ✅ Price now shows **$700**

**Continue this back-and-forth to demonstrate real-time bidding!**

## 🎥 **What to Show During Demo**

### **Key Points to Highlight:**

1. **Real-Time Updates** 
   - When one user bids, the other sees it within 5 seconds
   - No manual refresh needed

2. **Automatic UI Updates**
   - Current price changes automatically
   - Bid history updates in real-time
   - Minimum bid increments automatically

3. **Validation**
   - Try bidding lower than current price
   - Show error message: "Bid amount must be higher than current price"

4. **User Identification**
   - Each bid shows which user placed it
   - Timestamps for each bid
   - Logical clock increments

5. **Distributed System**
   - Show that bids are processed by different servers (check bid serverId in history)
   - Load balancing across 3 servers
   - Data consistency across all servers

---

## 🎭 **Demo Script Example**

**Narrator**: "Let me demonstrate the real-time bidding functionality of our distributed auction system."

1. **Show Setup**:
   - "I have two users logged in: bidder1 in Chrome and bidder2 in Firefox"
   - "Both are viewing the same auction: 'Vintage Guitar' with starting price $500"

2. **First Bid**:
   - "Bidder1 places a bid of $600..."
   - *Click Place Bid*
   - "Notice it updates immediately in their window"
   - "Now watch bidder2's window..."
   - *Wait 5 seconds*
   - "The price updates automatically to $600 - no refresh needed!"

3. **Bidding War**:
   - "Bidder2 responds with $650..."
   - *Click Place Bid*
   - "And bidder1 sees it update in real-time"
   - "Bidder1 counters with $700..."
   - *Continue back and forth*

4. **Show Validation**:
   - "What if bidder2 tries to bid $650 again?"
   - *Enter $650 and click*
   - "The system validates and shows: 'Bid amount must be higher than current price'"

5. **Show Distributed Features**:
   - "Looking at the bid history, notice the 'serverId' field"
   - "Bids are processed by different servers (1, 2, or 3)"
   - "This demonstrates our distributed architecture with load balancing"

6. **Conclusion**:
   - "All data is synchronized across all 3 servers"
   - "Updates are propagated in real-time"
   - "The system handles concurrent bids gracefully"

## 🔧 **Quick Setup Commands**

If you need to create test users via API:

```bash
# Create User 1
curl -s http://localhost/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "bidder1", "email": "bidder1@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Create User 2
curl -s http://localhost/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "bidder2", "email": "bidder2@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **When User 1 Places a Bid:**

**User 1 Window (Immediate)**:
- ✅ Success message appears
- ✅ Current price updates
- ✅ Bid appears at top of history
- ✅ Next minimum bid increments
- ✅ Place Bid button re-enabled

**User 2 Window (Within 5 seconds)**:
- ✅ Info notification: "New bid placed: $XXX"
- ✅ Current price updates automatically
- ✅ New bid appears in history
- ✅ Page stays on auction details (no reload)

### **Visual Indicators:**

- 🔵 **Blue notification** for new bids from others
- 🟢 **Green success** message for your own bids
- 🔴 **Red error** message for validation failures
- ⏱️ **Timestamp** for each bid
- 🔢 **Logical clock** incrementing with each bid

---

## 🎓 **Additional Demo Ideas**

### **Advanced Demonstrations:**

1. **Show 3+ Users**:
   - Open 3 browser windows
   - All bidding on same auction
   - Show updates propagating to all

2. **Server Failover**:
   - Stop one server: `docker-compose stop auction-server-2`
   - Continue bidding - still works!
   - Restart server: `docker-compose start auction-server-2`
   - Show data is synchronized

3. **Admin Monitoring**:
   - Login as admin in one window
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Show system metrics updating in real-time
   - Show server health status

4. **WebSocket vs REST**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Show WebSocket connection
   - See real-time messages in Network tab

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

**Issue**: Updates not showing in second window
- **Solution**: Wait 5 seconds for auto-refresh, or manually refresh page

**Issue**: "Please login to place a bid"
- **Solution**: Make sure user is logged in (check top-right corner for username)

**Issue**: Both windows share same session
- **Solution**: Use incognito/private window or different browser

**Issue**: Bid doesn't submit
- **Solution**: Check that bid amount is higher than current price
