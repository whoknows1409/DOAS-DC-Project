# üóÑÔ∏è DOAS Database Commands Cheatsheet

Quick reference for common database operations.

## üîå Connect to Database

## üë§ USER OPERATIONS

### View All Users
```sql
SELECT id, username, email, created_at FROM users;

DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'bad@example.com';
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

### Create Admin User (Manual)
```sql
-- Note: Password must be bcrypt hashed. Use backend to create users properly.
-- But if you need to manually update an existing user to admin:
-- (This won't work since role column might not exist, but for reference)
UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE username = 'admin';
```

### Change User Email
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE username = 'someuser';
```

## üìä USEFUL QUERIES

### View Auction with Highest Bid Count
```sql
SELECT a.title, COUNT(b.id) as bid_count 
FROM auctions a 
LEFT JOIN bids b ON a.id = b.auction_id 
GROUP BY a.id, a.title 
ORDER BY bid_count DESC;
```

### View User with Most Bids
```sql
SELECT u.username, COUNT(b.id) as bid_count 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN bids b ON u.id = b.bidder_id 
GROUP BY u.id, u.username 
ORDER BY bid_count DESC;
```

### View User with Most Auctions
```sql
SELECT u.username, COUNT(a.id) as auction_count 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN auctions a ON u.id = a.seller_id 
GROUP BY u.id, u.username 
ORDER BY auction_count DESC;
```

### View Auctions with Winner Info
```sql
SELECT 
    a.title, 
    a.current_price, 
    a.winner_name, 
    a.status,
    a.end_time
FROM auctions a 
WHERE a.winner_name IS NOT NULL;
```

### View All Data Summary
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as total_users,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auctions) as total_auctions,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bids) as total_bids,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auctions WHERE status = 'ACTIVE') as active_auctions,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auctions WHERE status = 'ENDED') as ended_auctions;
```

---

## üîç INSPECTION COMMANDS

### List All Tables
```sql
\dt
```

### Describe Table Structure
```sql
\d users
\d auctions
\d bids
```

### View Table with Column Details
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users';
```

---

## üßπ CLEANUP OPERATIONS

### Clear Everything
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE bids CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE auctions CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE users CASCADE;
```

### Clear Only Auctions and Bids (Keep Users)
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE bids CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE auctions CASCADE;
```

### Clear Only Bids (Keep Auctions and Users)
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE bids CASCADE;
```

### Delete Specific User and Their Data
```sql
-- Delete user's bids
DELETE FROM bids WHERE bidder_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser');

-- Delete user's auctions (and associated bids via CASCADE)
DELETE FROM auctions WHERE seller_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser');

-- Delete the user
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';
```

---

## üöÄ QUICK ONE-LINER COMMANDS

These can be run directly from your terminal (no need to connect to psql first):

### View All Users
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "SELECT username, email FROM users;"
```

### View All Auctions
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "SELECT title, status, current_price FROM auctions;"
```

### Delete User by Username
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'testuser';"
```

### Delete Auction by Title
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "DELETE FROM auctions WHERE title = 'My Auction';"
```

### Clear All Data
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "TRUNCATE TABLE bids, auctions, users CASCADE;"
```

### Count Everything
```bash
docker exec auction-system-postgres-1 psql -U auctionuser -d auctiondb -c "SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM users UNION ALL SELECT 'auctions', COUNT(*) FROM auctions UNION ALL SELECT 'bids', COUNT(*) FROM bids;"
```

## üí° TIPS

1. **Always use WHERE clause** when deleting to avoid accidents!
2. **CASCADE** automatically deletes related records (e.g., deleting auction deletes its bids)
3. **TRUNCATE** is faster than DELETE for clearing entire tables
4. **UUIDs** are the primary keys - copy them carefully
5. **Exit psql** with `\q` or `Ctrl+D`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

‚ùå **Don't run these by accident:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users;              -- Deletes ALL users!
DELETE FROM auctions;           -- Deletes ALL auctions!
TRUNCATE TABLE users CASCADE;   -- Clears ALL users!
```

‚úÖ **Always use WHERE:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'specific_user';
DELETE FROM auctions WHERE id = 'specific_id';
```

---

## üîê PASSWORD HASHING

To manually create a user with a password, you need bcrypt hash:

```bash
# Use this Python one-liner to generate bcrypt hash
python3 -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'mypassword', bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())"
```

Then insert:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at) 
VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(), 
    'newadmin', 
    'admin@example.com', 
    '$2b$10$hash_from_above_command_here',
    NOW(),
    NOW()
);
```

**Better approach:** Use the registration API endpoint instead!

## üìù Exit psql

```sql
\q
```

Or press `Ctrl+D`
